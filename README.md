# üéæ Tennis Scoring Kata

Source: [https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog)

## üíª Setup

Note: this assumes you have a recent-ish version of Python 3 and Poetry both setup locally. Be careful on the Poetry install; right now they're changing their installation process and you want to be sure to [use the new installation process](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation).

1. [Fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
1. Clone your forked repo to your local machine
1. (Optional) Checkout a task branch if you want to leave your `main` in pristine condition for easy resets: `git checkout -b interation1`
1. Install your dependencies: `poetry install`

You should now be ready to code!

Note that all the commands below assume your virtualenv is active. You can either do that by prefixing the command with `poetry run`, e.g., `poetry run ptw`, or you can spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated by running `poetry shell`.

- To run all tests: `pytest`
- To run all tests in watch mode: `ptw`
- To run a specific module of tests: `pytest test/test_tennis_scoring.py`
- To run a specific test: `pytest test/test_tennis_scoring.py::test_start_game` or `pytest test/test_tennis_scoring.py::TestGame::test_start`

## üè∏ Background

In a game of tennis, a player begins with a score of zero (0). With each success, the player earns more points. The points are earned in this sequence:

- 0
- 15
- 30
- 40

If a player has 40 and scores again, that player wins the game as long as the other player does not also have 40 points. If both players reach 40 points it is referred to as a 'deuce.'

Scoring during deuce give a player advantage. If the other player scores again, the score returns to deuce. If a player has advantage and scores again, that player wins the game.

## üìñ Instructions

Write a program to handle each of these requirements while scoring a two player game of tennis.

- Players must be able to score points
- The game must be able to be completed with a winner
- The 'deuce' case should be handled
- After a game has been won, a winner must be determined
- The current score of either player should be available at any point during the game
