Note: this assumes you have installed and activated the version of Node specified in the `.node-version` file. Note that tools like [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) handle this automatically.

1. [Fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
1. Clone your forked repo to your local machine
1. (Optional) Checkout a task branch if you want to leave your `main` in pristine condition for easy resets: `git checkout -b interation1`
1. Install your dependencies: `npm install`

You should now be ready to code!

- To run all tests: `npm test`
- To run a specific set of tests: `npx jest test/tennisScoring.test.ts`
